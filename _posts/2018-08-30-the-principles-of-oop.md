1.Encapsulate what varies

2.Flavor compositon over inheritance

3.Program to interface, not implementation

4.Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

5.Classed should be open to extension but closed to modification

6.Depend on abstraction not. Don't depend on concrete classes.
