###     Learn to love  

>To love is as much happy as to be loved  
Lsove is like the sunshine and the rain  
no need of condition  
no need of reason
just give,  
not take
quiet and generous

>Love can be learned by heart  
instead of brain
just like feel the sunshine and   
listen to the rain with breeze. 

>When you are in love,  
your lover is always by your side  
you feel like flying   
without self-consciousness  
just like the rain to the new budz.

>Love can help you  escape  
from the trap
which exists in your mind.  

>You are weak before the obstacles you set up yourself.  
The obstacles are nothing  
but to block your heart from the hope.  

>Just as a bud given sunshine and rain,  
can grow up to the sky,  
you will get a swing to flee your self-set trap   
if you learn to love.

>Thanking to love,   
which is the gift the god give us all  
We get strength  
We get power  
this is the payback we attribute to the god```
