				Self Introduction

Great pleasure to have the opportunity to introduce myself!

I am 31 years old and born in Qingtongxia, Ningxia China. I Graduated from

WHU with a bachaler degree in Engineering Mechanix in 2010. I am seeking an opportunity to take chanlleging job as Java developer.



My professional work experiences include Structure Engineering and software developing. During these working experiences, I have learned how to concentrate and focus on the commitments, how to solve problems under pressure and how to balance work from life. I'd like to say all these make me feel both life meaningful and happy.



In my free time, I often participate in a lot of activities, such as badminton, outside walking and gitar playing. All these make me relaxed and fullfilling.



 I am    looking forward to becoming your colleage on some day! Thanks!



Yours!

Liu Jiali
